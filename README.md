## Name

TweetABrew - An Arduino Project

## Synapsis

This project is uses the DS18B20 temerature sensor to moniter a home brew during the fermentation stage. It sends tweets at specified intervals or when they temp is out of specified range.

## Future Work

In the future, I would like to get a mini so that TweetABrew can adjust the temperature automatically. It currently only has one temperature sensor on the OneWire bus. It would be interesting to add another and monitor the internal temperature as well.
